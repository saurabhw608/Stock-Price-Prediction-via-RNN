# Stock-Price-Prediction-via-RNN
- The goal of the project was to predict, by implementing LSTM &amp; GRU models along with the Adam optimizer, the price of a stock at the next day's market close based on the stock market data collected from the past 5-year period. Thereafter, the one-step predictions for the stock prices and returns were compared with multi-step predictions for the same.
